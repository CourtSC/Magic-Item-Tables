This is a suite of programs to randomly generate a list of magic item rewards for a treasure hoard based on the CR of a D&D 5e monster's CR. The intention is to pull from all available D&D 5e magic items, though access to some items may be limited by purchases on DNDBEYOND. 

To get started:

1: Download and install python.

2: Run ddbScrape.py to generate the database.

3: Run magicItemTables.py to generate the list of item rewards.

4: View the treasure hoard items in the magicRewards.csv that is generated or copy them from the output in the terminal.

TODO LIST:
- Develop tables to generate monetary rewards.
- Refine algorithm for generating treasure hoards to better balance results.
- Unify entire project into a customizable UI.
